## 🚀 About the Project
SpamBuster is a machine-learning-based spam SMS detection system that helps users filter out unwanted messages. Developed during **DUHacks 4.0 Hackathon**, the project aims to enhance message security by accurately classifying SMS as spam or legitimate using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
